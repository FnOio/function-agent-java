abstract: >-
  This library enables execution of semantically described
  functions.


  The idea is that when: software A needs a certain
  functionality, and; software B provides that
  functionality, and; there is a description of the
  functionality and its implementation; then Function Agent
  can be called from A to execute functions of B.


  Describing functions can be done with the Function
  Ontology (FnO.io), or by providing another function model.
